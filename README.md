▪ The Road Signs application displays a number of UK road signs for learning/revising purposes.  

▪ Built using React.js. Components are reusable and state is passed where required.  

▪ Each road sign image has been created in Inkscape and saved in the SVG file format allowing for images to be scaled in size while losing no quality.  
  
▪ Responsive layout means the app can be resized across devices.
